## About
I gathered my data from a Kaggle dataset which contained 285,000 rows of data and 31 columns. I sampled out a data set of 30K rows. Out of all the columns, the only ones that made the most sense were Time, Amount, and Class (fraud or not fraud). The other 25 columns were transformed using what seems to be a PCA dimensionality reduction in order to protect user identities.

## Algorithms used 
* K-Nearest Neighbor Classifier
* Decision Tree Classifier
* Logistic Regression
* Random Forest Classifier
<b>
Improved the model accuracy using hyperparameter tuning techniques like Grid Search CV.
